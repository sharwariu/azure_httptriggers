# azure_httptriggers

In this project, a list of books is created using Python programming language. The purpose of this project is to create an API that allows users to access and manipulate this list of books using three different HTTP trigger functions: GET, PUT, and DELETE.

The GET function is used to retrieve the list of books from the API. When a user makes a GET request, the API returns the entire list of books as a JSON object. The user can then view this list of books and use it to make further requests to the API.

The PUT function is used to add new books to the list. When a user makes a PUT request, This book get added and the API returns a success message indicating that the new book has been added.

The DELETE function is used to remove books from the list. When a user makes a DELETE request,top book is removed. The API returns a success message indicating that the book has been removed.

By creating this API, users can easily access and manipulate the list of books using simple HTTP requests. This allows them to easily view, add, and remove books from the list without having to interact directly with the Python code. The API also provides a convenient and scalable way to store and manage large amounts of data, making it an ideal solution for organizations with large collections of books or other types of data.
